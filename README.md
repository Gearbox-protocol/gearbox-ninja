# MelonJS with TypeScript and WebPack

A MelonJS tutorial Boilerplate replacement using TypeScript and WebPack. The bootstrapping is done in
the `main.ts` file instead of the `game.ts` file, so when following the tutorial you will usually find it's 
thi `main.ts` file that needs updating instead of the advised `game.ts`.

When looking for a games framework, MelonJS looked good but didn't have any examples of using WebPack 
TypeScript. There was an [incomplete example of using ES6](https://gist.github.com/rvanzon/ccfb86c2fff3e31899fb) 
which provided some inspiration.  

## Set up

Clone the repository locally. You will need `node v10.x.x` or later and `npm v6.9.0` or later. In the
project directory, run `npm install` to download the dependencies (including MelonJS).

## Running the app

Launch the app locally by running `npm run dev`. That should automatically open a browser window with 
your application running. WebPack will hot reload any changes you make to the code, which are then 
reflected straight away in the browser.# ninja-game
